# Career Growth

Growing as a front-end engineer is about more than just technical skills.

## The Career Ladder

```
Staff+ Engineer     → Technical Leadership, Architecture
Senior Engineer     → Ownership, Mentoring, Complex Problems
Mid-level Engineer  → Independence, Feature Delivery
Junior Engineer     → Learning, Growth, Fundamentals
```

## What Senior Engineers Do Differently

1. **Think in systems, not features**
2. **Communicate proactively**
3. **Mentor others**
4. **Drive technical decisions**
5. **Balance trade-offs effectively**

# Interview Preparation

A structured approach to preparing for front-end engineering interviews at top companies.

## Interview Types

### 1. Coding Interviews

Focus areas for front-end:
- DOM manipulation algorithms
- Array/Object transformations
- Async programming challenges
- React component implementation

```javascript
// Example: Implement debounce
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}
```

### 2. System Design

Common front-end system design questions:
- Design a news feed
- Design an autocomplete
- Design a real-time dashboard
- Design a file uploader

### 3. Behavioral

Use the STAR method:
- **S**ituation: Set the context
- **T**ask: Describe your responsibility
- **A**ction: Explain what you did
- **R**esult: Share the outcome

## Preparation Timeline

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1-2 | JavaScript fundamentals review |
| 3-4 | React deep dive |
| 5-6 | Algorithms & data structures |
| 7-8 | System design |
| 9-10 | Mock interviews |

## Salary Negotiation

- Research market rates (levels.fyi, Glassdoor)
- Let them make the first offer
- Negotiate total compensation, not just base
- Get offers in writing
